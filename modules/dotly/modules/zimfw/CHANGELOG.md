# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Prompt before uninstalling modules, unless `-q` is set.

### Fixed
- Show error when no parameter is provided to `-c|--cmd`.

## [1.3.2] - 2020-08-01

### Fixed
- Compiled files must also be cleaned from modules defined with absolute paths.

## [1.3.1] - 2020-07-24

### Fixed
- "gzip: stdin: unexpected end of file" error when trying to upgrade.
  (See [#407](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw/issues/407))

## [1.3.0] - 2020-07-05

### Added
- `-c|-cmd` option to `zmodule`. This allows for executing any specified command.

## [1.2.2] - 2020-06-10

### Fixed
- Allow local modules to be initialized and compiled in their respective
  directories, when absolute paths are given, instead of forcing them to be
  installed inside `ZIM_HOME`.

## [1.2.1] - 2020-05-26

### Fixed
- "No such file or directory" error when building a new file. This was a
  regression introduced after replacing `cmp` by `cksum` in version 1.2.0.
- Show warning message when nothing found to be initialized in a module.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-05-17

### Changed
- Use `cksum` instead of `cmp`, and `zargs` instead of `xargs`, so we don't
  depend on busybox or diffutils and findutils.

### Fixed
- Error messages and the `zmodule` usage text.

## [1.1.1] - 2020-01-26

### Fixed
- "no such file or directory" error before initial check for latest version.
- Show error when no modules defined in .zimrc, instead of allowing xargs to
  execute the action with no positional parameters.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-01-20

### Added
- `help` and `version` actions.
- `-v` verbose option. Normal mode output is now focused on the specified action.
- Asynchronously check the latest version every 30 days. This can be disabled
  with `zstyle ':zim' disable-version-check yes`.

### Changed
- When upgrading, download latest release asset instead of raw file from the
  master branch.
- `curl` is preferred over `wget`.
  (See [#360](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw/issues/360))
- `wget`'s output is only shown in verbose mode.

## [1.0.1] - 2020-01-09

### Fixed
- Zsh 5.2 does not recognize the `:P` modifier. Replace it by `:A`.
- Also compile and clean .zprofile among the startup files.
- Don't fail on `clean-dumpfile` when there's nothing to remove.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-01-07

This is a major change, where modules are not git submodules in the Zim repo
anymore, but customized and installed separately as individual repositories.
External modules can more easily be installed, updated and uninstalled. This
makes Zim the first project for Zsh that is both a set of community-maintained
modules with a default installation (like on-my-zsh and prezto) and a plugin
manager (like antigen and zplug).

This version is not backwards-compatible with previous versions, so a new
installation of Zim is required.

Take your time to review the updated [README.md] and the changes listed below.

### Added
- `zimfw` CLI tool.
- `zmodule` function to define modules.
- Automatic installation script.
- zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions is enabled by default in new installations.

### Changed
- The Zim "core" is reduced to a single file, namely zimfw.zsh, that is
  self-updated without requiring git. With this, `ZIM_HOME` is not (the root of)
  a git repo anymore.
- Zsh and modules are configured in .zshrc instead of .zimrc.
- .zimrc is not sourced during Zsh startup anymore, and only contains the module
  definitions.
- Zim's init.zsh and login_init.zsh scripts are generated by the `zimfw` CLI
  tool and contain static code. This allows for constant startup time,
  regardless of how complex the module definitions are.
- Zim modules moved to individual repositories in the https://github.com/zimfw
  organization.
- Zim modules are configured with `zstyle` instead of environment variables.
- Zim themes are sourced directly, instead of working with prompinit, and are
  configured with environment variables instead of with promptinit parameters.
- The [environment] module is reduced in scope to to only set Zsh options. The
  additional code moved to the [input] module (smart-URL widgets), the [utility]
  module (default pager), and a new [termtitle] module (terminal window title).
- The minimal theme is renamed to [s1ck94].

### Removed
- `zmanage` CLI tool.
- The directory and history modules. Their code moved into the [environment]
  module.
- The prompt module, and the external lean, liquidprompt and pure themes.
  Use `zmodule miekg/lean`, or `zmodule nojhan/liquidprompt`, or `zmodule
  sindresorhus/pure --source async.zsh --source pure.zsh` to define one of these
  external themes, respectively. The Zim themes moved to individual repositories.
- Support for themes that require promptinit.
  (See [#325](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw/issues/325))

### Fixed
- `ZIM_HOME` is set in .zshenv instead of .zshrc. The issue was that the
  variable was not available in .zlogin in non-interactive login shells.
